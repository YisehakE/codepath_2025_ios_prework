## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

### Favorite Applications & their Features
1. ChatGPT
  - Simple UI
  - Prompting with AI
2. LinkedIn
  - Amazing UI
  - Accessibility
  - Personalized content
  - Community feed
3. Google Calendar

### Potential App Idea
- **Type**: Improving existing app
- **App**: Reddit
- **Idea**: the current way comment replies collapse is annoying. You'll get interested in a comment thread, then you see scattered collapsed comments with any number of replies. I would implement 1) a more simplistic layout, and 2)some feature that allows you to extract out the most liked replies or a filter search.

## Notes

Some challenges I faced was fixing bugs that came up for build targets (namely multiple build files or none at all). I also faced the challenge of finding the inspector navigation view, since I am new to XCode.
